# Session: 2026-01-25 13:56

## User

i want to clean up the project tree if necessary: i don't think we need this folder and its content in the project: \\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu\home\fisch\projects\deck-forge\ai-economic-future it probably should be moved here: \\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu\home\fisch\presentations

## Claude

Let me check if that folder exists and then move it to the presentations directory.

### Actions

- 💻 `ls -la /home/fisch/projects/deck-forge/ai-economic-future 2>/dev/null || echo "Folder not found"` — Check if ai-economic-future folder exists
### Actions

- 💻 `ls -la /home/fisch/presentations 2>/dev/null || echo "Presentations folder not found"` — Check presentations folder exists

## Claude

The folder exists with a completed deck. Moving it to `~/presentations/` now.

### Actions

- 💻 `mv /home/fisch/projects/deck-forge/ai-economic-future /home/fisch/presentations/ && echo "Moved succ...` — Move deck folder to presentations directory

## Claude

Done. Moved `ai-economic-future` to `~/presentations/`. The deck-forge project is now clean.

## User

do we have a hook or some mechanism to move decks to ~/presentations in an automated way when we finish working so the project tree does not get cluttered

## Claude

Let me check what automation exists for this.

### Actions

- 🔍 Glob `**/.claude*/**/*` in `.`
### Actions

- 💻 `ls -la /home/fisch/projects/deck-forge/scripts/` — List scripts in the project
### Actions

- 💻 `cat /home/fisch/.claude/settings.json 2>/dev/null | head -50` — Check Claude Code hooks configuration

### Actions

- 📖 Read `/home/fisch/projects/deck-forge/.claude/hooks/session-end.sh`
### Actions

- 📖 Read `/home/fisch/projects/deck-forge/.claude/settings.json`



## Claude

Currently there's a `SessionEnd` hook that archives session logs, but it doesn't handle deck cleanup. The session-end hook just runs `archive-session.sh` and shows a reminder.

There's no automation for moving decks to `~/presentations/`. A few options:

1. **Add to session-end hook** - Detect deck folders at project root and either:
   - Auto-move them (risky - might move unfinished work)
   - Print a reminder listing folders to move

2. **Create a separate script** - `scripts/archive-deck.sh <deck-name>` that you run manually when a deck is done

3. **Interactive prompt in hook** - Ask during session end whether to move each detected deck folder

Which approach would you prefer? Option 2 (manual script) is safest since you explicitly choose when a deck is "done." Option 1 with a reminder is low-friction but requires manual follow-up.

## User

with option 1, you would move them not delete them so i don't think that is a risk, and i can always re-prompt to recreate the deck, true?

## Claude

You're right. Moving is non-destructive, and with session logs archived you can recreate any deck from the original prompts. Let me add auto-move to the session-end hook.

### Actions

- 📖 Read `/home/fisch/projects/deck-forge/.claude/hooks/session-end.sh`

### Actions

- ✂️ Edited `/home/fisch/projects/deck-forge/.claude/hooks/session-end.sh`


## Claude

Now let me update the CLAUDE.md to reflect this automation.

### Actions

- 📖 Read `/home/fisch/projects/deck-forge/CLAUDE.md`

### Actions

- ✂️ Edited `/home/fisch/projects/deck-forge/CLAUDE.md`


## Claude

Done. The session-end hook now automatically:
1. Finds any folders at project root containing `deck.md`
2. Moves them to `~/presentations/`
3. Skips if a deck with the same name already exists there (to avoid accidental overwrites)

Updated CLAUDE.md to reflect this automation. When you end a session, any decks in the project will be archived automatically.

## User

what is the purpose of \\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu\home\fisch\projects\deck-forge\output? this might also need clean-up?

### Actions

- 💻 `ls -la /home/fisch/projects/deck-forge/output 2>/dev/null || echo "Folder not found"` — Check output folder contents

## Claude

Looks like orphaned build outputs - probably from testing the build script. The files are from mid-January:
- `deck-forge-overview.html` - likely a demo/test build
- `deck.pdf` - generic leftover

This isn't part of a proper deck folder structure (which would be `my-deck/output/`). Safe to delete.

### Actions

- 💻 `rm -r /home/fisch/projects/deck-forge/output && echo "Removed output folder"` — Remove orphaned output folder

## Claude

Done. Want me to scan for any other stray folders that don't belong at project root?

## User

yes

### Actions

- 💻 `ls -la /home/fisch/projects/deck-forge/` — List all items at project root

## Claude

Project root looks clean. Let me verify the folders not explicitly in the project map.

### Actions

- 💻 `ls -la /home/fisch/projects/deck-forge/docs/` — Check docs folder
### Actions

- 💻 `ls -la /home/fisch/projects/deck-forge/examples/` — Check examples folder
### Actions

- 💻 `ls -la /home/fisch/projects/deck-forge/tests/` — Check tests folder
### Actions

- 💻 `ls -la /home/fisch/projects/deck-forge/docs/investigations/` — Check docs/investigations
### Actions

- 💻 `ls -la /home/fisch/projects/deck-forge/tests/diagrams/` — Check tests/diagrams
### Actions

- 📖 Read `/home/fisch/projects/deck-forge/docs/investigations/INDEX.md`


## Claude

Here's what I found:

| Folder | Contents | Status |
|--------|----------|--------|
| `examples/` | `deck-forge-overview.md` - sample deck | Keep - reference material |
| `tests/diagrams/` | `run_tests.py` + fixtures | Keep - diagram test suite |
| `docs/investigations/` | Empty INDEX.md only | **Can remove** - unused placeholder |

Everything else is core project infrastructure (`.claude/`, `scripts/`, `templates/`, etc.).

Want me to remove the empty `docs/investigations/` folder? Or keep it as a placeholder for future use?

## User

help me recall the purpose of this folder, search project memory if necessary, do we have a workflow where we would work interactively to do experimentation?

### Actions

- 🔍 Grep `investigations` in `/home/fisch/projects/deck-forge`
### Actions

- 🔍 Grep `investigation` in `/home/fisch/projects/deck-forge/.session_logs`


### Actions

- 📖 Read `/home/fisch/projects/deck-forge/.claude/INVESTIGATION_PROTOCOL.md`


## Claude

Found it. The `docs/investigations/` folder is part of your **knowledge management system** defined in `.claude/INVESTIGATION_PROTOCOL.md`.

**Purpose:** Structured documentation for technical investigations - when you:
- Test a hypothesis and reach a conclusion
- Debug a complex issue and find root cause
- Evaluate an approach and make a decision
- Try something that fails and learn from it

**Workflow:**
1. Do exploratory/experimental work in a session
2. When investigation concludes, prompt: "Document this investigation"
3. Claude creates a structured doc with hypothesis, experiments, findings, decisions
4. Doc links back to session logs for full context

**For deck-forge**, this could capture things like:
- Mermaid rendering quirks discovered
- Theme/CSS debugging
- PDF export issues solved

The folder is empty because no investigations have been documented yet - it's infrastructure waiting to be used.

**Verdict:** Keep it if you want structured memory for technical discoveries. Remove it if session logs + scratchpad are sufficient for this project's needs.

## User

lets keep it, and prepare to end this session

## Claude

Keeping `docs/investigations/`.

**Session summary - what we did:**
1. Moved `ai-economic-future/` deck to `~/presentations/`
2. Removed orphaned `output/` folder
3. Added auto-archiving to session-end hook - decks now auto-move to `~/presentations/` when sessions end
4. Updated CLAUDE.md to reflect the automation

**When you exit**, the SessionEnd hook will:
- Archive this session to `.session_logs/`
- Auto-move any deck folders (none currently at project root)

You can end the session with `/exit` or `Ctrl+C`.
