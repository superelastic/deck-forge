lets create a slide deck from this doc, @/home/fisch/projects/VST_Equity Research Memo_Vistra Corp.pdf  , no more than 20 slides,
  propose possible narrative structures if there is any uncertainty about the best approach, use a technical slide style

## Claude

I'll read the source document and the rhetoric principles to understand the content and design approach.

### Actions

- 📖 Read `/home/fisch/projects/VST_Equity Research Memo_Vistra Corp.pdf`

## Claude

I've reviewed the memo. This is a dense equity research piece with a clear investment thesis. Given the content, there are three viable narrative structures for a 20-slide technical deck:

---

## Proposed Narrative Structures

### **Option A: Investment Case (Recommended)**
Classic equity pitch format - leads with the thesis, walks through supporting pillars.

| Section | Slides | Content |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Thesis & Rating | 1-2 | BUY / $245 PT / 36% upside, one-sentence thesis |
| Key Drivers | 3-6 | Meta PPA, Cogentrix, capacity super-cycle, capital allocation |
| Market Context | 7-9 | Grid scarcity, PJM/ERCOT dynamics, data center demand |
| Asset Portfolio | 10-11 | Nuclear + gas fleet, competitive positioning |
| Financials | 12-14 | EBITDA step-up, hedging, FCF, valuation |
| Risks & Catalysts | 15-17 | Risk table, scenarios, what to watch |
| Summary | 18-20 | Bull/base/bear, price target bridge, appendix |

**Best for**: Investment committee, PMs who want the punchline first

---

### **Option B: Transformation Story**
Frames the narrative arc: "How a cyclical IPP became essential AI infrastructure"

| Section | Slides | Content |
|---------|--------|---------|
| The Shift | 1-3 | Old IPP model vs. new "Growth Utility" thesis |
| Why Now | 4-7 | Grid crisis, data center explosion, regulatory moats |
| The Assets | 8-10 | Hybrid fleet advantage, Meta deal as proof point |
| The Numbers | 11-14 | Revenue transformation, EBITDA trajectory |
| Valuation & Risk | 15-18 | Multiple expansion case, key risks |
| Conclusion | 19-20 | Summary, catalysts |

**Best for**: Generalist investors needing context on why power matters now

---

### **Option C: Market Dynamics First**
Macro-to-micro: start with the opportunity, then show why Vistra captures it

| Section | Slides | Content |
|---------|--------|---------|
| The Grid Crisis | 1-4 | Supply/demand imbalance, capacity prices hitting caps |
| The AI Demand Wave | 5-7 | Data centers need 24/7 power, hyperscaler requirements |
| Vistra's Position | 8-12 | Fleet, Meta PPA, Cogentrix, regulatory strategy |
| Financial Model | 13-16 | Unit economics, EBITDA, FCF |
| Investment Case | 17-20 | Valuation, risks, catalysts, rating |

**Best for**: Sector specialists, those who follow energy but don't know Vistra

---

**My recommendation**: Option A provides the clearest "assertion-first" structure per the rhetoric principles. Analysts and PMs want the conclusion upfront, then supporting evidence.

Which structure would you like me to build?

**Quality checklist verified:**

- Conclusion in slide 2 (pyramid principle)
- Transition slides mark section boundaries
- Summary echoes "3 things to remember"
- Tables used instead of bullets where possible

**To preview:**
```bash
./scripts/build.sh preview vistra-equity-research/deck.md
```

Want me to build a preview, adjust any slides, or modify the visual density?

## User

preview it

### Actions

- 💻 `./scripts/build.sh preview vistra-equity-research/deck.md` — Launch Marp preview server




























### Actions

- 💻 `cat /tmp/claude/-home-fisch-projects-deck-forge/tasks/bef71e2.output` — Check preview server output

## Claude

Preview server is running. The deck should open in your browser at:

```
file:///home/fisch/projects/deck-forge/vistra-equity-research/deck.html
```

The server is watching for changes — edits to `deck.md` will auto-refresh.

To stop the preview server when done, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal or run:
```bash
kill %1
```

Let me know what adjustments you'd like after reviewing.
