## User

i want to create a deck for this file: \\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu\home\fisch\projects\gigapower_narratives\docs\gigapower_efficiency_metrics_overview.md

## Claude

Let me read the source file and the rhetoric principles to get started.

### Actions

- 📖 Read `/home/fisch/projects/gigapower_narratives/docs/gigapower_efficiency_metrics_overview.md`
### Actions

- 📖 Read `/home/fisch/projects/deck-forge/principles/rhetoric.md`



## Claude

I've read the source document and the rhetoric principles. Before I create the deck, let me clarify a few things.

### Actions

- ❓ Asked: Who is the audience for this presentation?

## Claude

Got it. A detailed async deck for the data/analytics team focused on data limitations. Let me check the available templates and set up the project.

### Actions

- 🔍 Glob `templates/*.md` in `.`
### Actions

- 🔍 Glob `themes/*.css` in `.`


### Actions

- 📖 Read `/home/fisch/projects/deck-forge/templates/technical-explainer.md`
### Actions

- 💻 `ls -la /home/fisch/projects/deck-forge/themes/` — List theme files

### Actions

- 💻 `find /home/fisch/projects/deck-forge/themes -name "*.css" -o -name "*.scss" 2>/dev/null | head -20` — Find theme files

## Claude

Good. I have the templates and themes. For a technical data team, I'll use the "turing" theme.

Let me first propose an outline of the slide structure for your approval. This follows the rhetoric principles (assertions as titles, lead with conclusions).

---

## Proposed Outline: Gigapower Efficiency Metrics

**Section 1: The Punchline (3 slides)**
1. **Title**: Gigapower Installation Efficiency Metrics: What We Can (and Can't) Measure
2. **Key finding**: 8 metrics are calculable, 6 are blocked by data gaps
3. **The critical limitation**: Dispatch logging only reliable from Q4 2025

**Section 2: What We CAN Measure (4 slides)**
4. **Current baseline meets industry benchmarks** — table of our 8 metrics vs benchmarks
5. **Dispatch coverage improved dramatically in Q4 2025** — coverage timeline chart
6. **Data sources are fragmented across tables** — table-to-metric mapping
7. **Additional metrics are derivable but not yet calculated** — slippage, days in jeopardy

**Section 3: What We CANNOT Measure (5 slides)**
8. **Six key metrics have zero data coverage** — the gaps
9. **ML dispatch tables contain no Gigapower installs** — evidence
10. **Technician-level data is completely absent** — VCTD601 gap
11. **Repeat visit tables track repairs only, not installs** — VCTD555 limitation
12. **Customer satisfaction is a blind spot** — no direct measurement

**Section 4: Why This Matters (3 slides)**
13. **Data gaps block meaningful optimization** — business impact
14. **Historical trend analysis is impossible for dispatch metrics** — Q4 constraint
15. **Satisfaction proxies provide limited insight** — what we can infer

**Section 5: Path Forward (3 slides)**
16. **Recommended actions: Short, medium, and long-term** — the roadmap
17. **Summary: Five things to know** — key takeaways
18. **Appendix: Data source reference** — table coverage summary

---

Does this structure work, or would you like me to adjust the emphasis?

## User

where could we mention that our data source seems to be a combination of AT&T legacy fiber install data,gigapower install data,the 'FIBERCO' flag indicates gigapower data,and that our data may not allow us to calculate the same metrics for Gigapower that we could calculate for AT&T legacy fiber?

## Claude

Great point — that's essential context that explains *why* the gaps exist. It should come early, right after the title, to frame everything that follows.

Here's the revised outline with that context added:

---

## Revised Outline

**Section 1: The Punchline (4 slides)**
1. **Title**: Gigapower Installation Efficiency Metrics: What We Can (and Can't) Measure
2. **Our data combines two different worlds** — AT&T legacy fiber + Gigapower in shared tables, `FIBERCO` flag identifies Gigapower ← **NEW**
3. **Gigapower has less data coverage than AT&T legacy** — Tables populated for legacy may be empty for Gigapower ← **NEW**
4. **Bottom line: 8 metrics calculable, 6 blocked by data gaps**
5. **Critical constraint: Dispatch logging only reliable from Q4 2025**

**Section 2: What We CAN Measure (4 slides)**
6. Current baseline meets industry benchmarks
7. Dispatch coverage improved dramatically in Q4 2025
8. Data sources are fragmented across tables
9. Additional metrics are derivable but not yet calculated

**Section 3: What We CANNOT Measure (5 slides)**
10. Six key metrics have zero Gigapower data ← emphasize "for Gigapower"
11. ML dispatch tables contain no Gigapower installs
12. Technician-level data is completely absent for FIBERCO
13. Repeat visit tables track repairs only, not installs
14. Customer satisfaction is a blind spot

**Section 4: Why This Matters (3 slides)**
15. Data gaps block meaningful optimization
16. Historical trend analysis is impossible for dispatch metrics
17. Satisfaction proxies provide limited insight

**Section 5: Path Forward (2 slides)**
18. Recommended actions: Short, medium, and long-term
19. Summary: Five things to know

**Appendix**
20. Data source reference table

---

This puts the AT&T/Gigapower data dichotomy front and center (slides 2-3) so every subsequent gap slide makes sense in that context. Sound good?

## User

yes

## Claude

Let me create the deck now.

### Actions

- 💻 `mkdir -p /home/fisch/projects/deck-forge/gigapower-metrics/{img,output}` — Create deck folder structure
### Actions

- ✏️ Wrote `/home/fisch/projects/deck-forge/gigapower-metrics/deck.md` (389 lines)


## Claude

Done. Let me build a preview so you can see it.

### Actions

- 💻 `./scripts/build.sh preview gigapower-metrics/deck.md 2>&1 | head -20` — Build preview of deck

























































































































## Claude

Let me check the session logs for the previous footer fix.

### Actions

- 🔍 Grep `footer|padding|overflow` in `/home/fisch/projects/deck-forge/.session_logs`


## Claude

Found it. The fix is to add `padding: 50px 50px 80px 50px` (80px bottom) in a scoped style. Let me update the deck.

### Actions

- 📖 Read `/home/fisch/projects/deck-forge/gigapower-metrics/deck.md`

### Actions

- ✂️ Edited `/home/fisch/projects/deck-forge/gigapower-metrics/deck.md`
### Actions

- 💻 `pkill -f "marp.*preview" 2>/dev/null; ./scripts/build.sh preview gigapower-metrics/deck.md 2>&1 &` — Restart preview with padding fix
### Actions

- 💻 `./scripts/build.sh preview gigapower-metrics/deck.md` — Start preview with padding fix
### Actions

- 💻 `sleep 2 && cat /tmp/claude/-home-fisch-projects-deck-forge/tasks/bd9ee38.output 2>/dev/null | head -...` — Check preview status


## Claude

Preview is running. The deck is now at `gigapower-metrics/deck.md` with:

- **22 slides** (including section dividers and appendix)
- **80px bottom padding** to prevent footer overflow
- AT&T/Gigapower data distinction on slides 2-3 as you requested

The structure:
1. Title
2-3. Data source context (AT&T legacy vs Gigapower, FIBERCO flag)
4-5. Key findings and Q4 2025 constraint
6-10. What we CAN measure (with benchmarks)
11-16. What we CANNOT measure (the focus)
17-19. Business impact
20-21. Recommendations and summary
22-24. Appendix (data reference, sources)

Check the preview in your browser. Let me know if any slides still overflow or if you want to adjust content on specific slides.

## User

this must be a brittle fix, some slides are fixed, but not slide 4. do you need a screenshot

## Claude

Yes, a screenshot would help. But let me also check slide 4 - it might have a scoped `<style scoped>` that's overriding the global padding, or just too much content.

### Actions

- 📖 Read `/home/fisch/projects/deck-forge/gigapower-metrics/deck.md`


## Claude

I see slide 4 has a `<style scoped>` block that might be interfering. Let me fix all the scoped styles to preserve the padding.

### Actions

- 🔍 Grep `<style scoped>` in `/home/fisch/projects/deck-forge/gigapower-metrics/deck.md`

### Actions

- ✂️ Edited `/home/fisch/projects/deck-forge/gigapower-metrics/deck.md`

### Actions

- ✂️ Edited `/home/fisch/projects/deck-forge/gigapower-metrics/deck.md`

## Claude

Updated all 3 scoped styles to include the padding. The preview should auto-refresh. 

If it's still overflowing, a screenshot would help - but it might also just be too much content for the slide. Let me know what you see.

## User

there should be a way to adjust table size and or font size when this occurs, but you dont seem to have an a priori way to know when it will happen

## Claude

You're right - I'm working blind. I generate markdown but can't see the rendered output to know when content overflows.

A few options:

1. **Conservative defaults** - Add a global style that makes all tables smaller by default (e.g., `table { font-size: 0.8em; }`)

2. **Content limits** - I could follow stricter rules like "max 6-7 table rows per slide" or "split large tables across slides"

3. **Post-build check** - You flag overflow issues and I fix them reactively (what we're doing now)

Let me apply option 1 as a baseline - make all tables smaller globally so they're less likely to overflow:

### Actions

- ✂️ Edited `/home/fisch/projects/deck-forge/gigapower-metrics/deck.md`

## Claude

Preview should update. That sets all tables to 80% font size by default.

Should I also document this as a guideline in `agent_docs/` - something like "tables with 7+ rows need `font-size: 0.75em`" and "max ~8 content lines per slide"? That way future deck generation would be more conservative from the start.

## User

yes, add that

### Actions

- 📖 Read `/home/fisch/projects/deck-forge/agent_docs/slide-creation-rules.md`

### Actions

- ✂️ Edited `/home/fisch/projects/deck-forge/agent_docs/slide-creation-rules.md`


## Claude

Added to `agent_docs/slide-creation-rules.md`. 

Let me also check the current deck for slides that might violate these guidelines and fix them proactively.

### Actions

- 💻 `grep -n "^|" /home/fisch/projects/deck-forge/gigapower-metrics/deck.md | head -60` — Count table rows per slide
### Actions

- 💻 `grep -n "^|" /home/fisch/projects/deck-forge/gigapower-metrics/deck.md | tail -40` — Check remaining tables

## Claude

Spotted a couple of dense slides. Let me add smaller fonts to the problematic ones:

## Claude

I see the issue. Slide 4 has the table plus that bottom text line, which overflows into the footer area. The text "Customer satisfaction requires external data sources — none are currently" is getting cut off.

Options:
1. **Remove the bottom text** (the table speaks for itself)
2. **Move the note into the table** (add it as a table footnote or merge into a cell)
3. **Split into two slides**

I'd recommend option 1 — the table already shows "Customer Satisfaction" in the "Not Calculable" column. Let me remove that redundant line:
