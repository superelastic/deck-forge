lets create a slide deck from this doc, @/home/fisch/projects/LRGR_Equity Research Memo Request.pdf , no more than 20 slides, propose possible narrative structures if there is any uncertainty about the best approach, use a technical slide style

## Claude

I'll read the PDF document and the rhetoric principles to understand the content and ensure the deck follows the established guidelines.

## Claude

I've read the equity research memo on Luminar Media Group (LRGR). This is a detailed investment analysis covering a micro-cap fintech pivoting from a media shell to a Latino-focused SMB lender, with a BUY recommendation and $1.75 target price (157% upside).

Given the content density and technical nature, here are **three possible narrative structures** for the deck:

---

## Narrative Option A: Classic Investment Pitch (Recommended)

**Structure**: Lead with conclusion, support with evidence

1. Title + Investment Snapshot (recommendation, target, key stats)
2. Three-pillar thesis overview
3. Deep-dive each pillar (Uplist Arbitrage → Demographic Alpha → Operational Leverage)
4. Financials proving the thesis
5. Risks acknowledged
6. Valuation and scenarios
7. Call to action

**Best for**: Institutional audience, time-constrained presentations

---

## Narrative Option B: Problem → Solution → Opportunity

**Structure**: Storytelling arc

1. The problem: Banks abandoned small business lending
2. The gap: Latino SMBs are underbanked despite $3T+ GDP
3. The solution: Fortun's cash-flow-first model
4. The proof: Financial performance
5. The catalyst: NASDAQ uplist
6. The opportunity: Valuation disconnect

**Best for**: Broader audience, building understanding from first principles

---

## Narrative Option C: Catalyst-Centric

**Structure**: Event-driven framework

1. The catalyst: NASDAQ uplist imminent
2. Why it matters: 2-4x multiple expansion historically
3. Why LRGR deserves it: governance cleanup, audits, financials
4. Downside protection: profitable, growing, moated
5. Risk/reward asymmetry

**Best for**: Traders and event-driven investors

---

Which narrative structure would you prefer? Or should I proceed with **Option A** (the classic investment pitch), which aligns best with the technical slide style and the memo's structure?

## User

option A

### Slide Flow

| # | Title (Assertion) |

| 5 | Institutional capital cannot access LRGR at current prices |
| 6 | Management has systematically cleared every uplist hurdle |
| 7 | *Transition: Pillar 2 - Demographic Alpha* |

| 9 | Fortun's "Cash Flow First" model bypasses the FICO bottleneck |
| 10 | *Transition: Pillar 3 - Operational Leverage* |
| 11 | 61% revenue growth with ~49% net margins is an industry outlier |
| 12 | Revenue-Based Financing aligns lender and borrower incentives |
| 13 | The renewal flywheel doubles profitability per customer |
| 14 | Balance sheet has been systematically de-risked |
| 15 | LRGR trades at a discount despite superior growth metrics |

## User

the deck has tables that need a color adjustment; the font color is very light relative to the background color used in the table cells. highlighting a table entry with my mouse improves the color selection, but we should improve the table style. you can look at this example @/home/fisch/projects/LRGR_slide.png 

## Claude

I can see the issue - the table text is too light against the alternating row backgrounds. Let me adjust the theme's table styling for better contrast.

### Actions

- 📖 Read `/home/fisch/projects/deck-forge/themes/technical/turing.css`

## Claude

I see the problem - the `td` cells don't have an explicit text color, and the muted inherited color doesn't contrast well. Let me fix the table styling.

### Actions

- ✂️ Edited `/home/fisch/projects/deck-forge/themes/technical/turing.css`


## Claude

Now let me rebuild the PDF with the updated theme.

### Actions

- 💻 `/home/fisch/projects/deck-forge/scripts/build.sh pdf /home/fisch/projects/deck-forge/lrgr-equity-res...` — Rebuild PDF with updated table styling


## Claude

Done. Updated the table styling in `themes/technical/turing.css`:

**Changes:**
- Set `td` text color to `#ffffff` (pure white) for maximum contrast
- Added alternating row backgrounds with subtle transparency
- Changed hover state to a subtle accent-tinted highlight
- Ensured `strong` text in table cells stays accent-colored
- Bumped header font-weight to 600

The PDF has been rebuilt at `lrgr-equity-research/output/deck.pdf`. The table text should now be clearly readable against all row backgrounds.

## User

we need to work more on this, even the html version has table entries that are hard to see: @/home/fisch/projects/LRGR_slide.png 

## Claude

I see - the text is still too light gray. The default Marp styles are likely overriding my changes. Let me make the CSS more aggressive with higher specificity and `!important` declarations.

## Claude

Rebuilt both outputs. Changes made:

1. **Increased CSS specificity** - Used `section table tbody tr td` selectors to override Marp defaults
2. **Added `!important`** - Ensures our styles take precedence
3. **Explicit white text** - `color: #ffffff !important` on all `td` elements
4. **Consistent row backgrounds** - Both odd and even rows now have explicit backgrounds

Files updated:
- `lrgr-equity-research/output/deck.html`
- `lrgr-equity-research/output/deck.pdf`

Please check if the table text is now readable. If it's still showing light gray, the issue may be deeper in Marp's rendering - in which case we could try inlining styles directly in the markdown as a workaround.
