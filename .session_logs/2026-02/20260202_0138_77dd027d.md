## User

do you have a project memory feature? search for working on a deck that discussed "NMA migration"

## Claude

Yes, this project has session memory stored in `.session_logs/`. Let me search for any past work on "NMA migration".

### Actions

- 🔍 Grep `NMA migration` in `.session_logs`


## Claude

Found it. There are multiple sessions about an **NMA Migration Toolkit** deck. Let me get the details from the main session.

### Actions

- 📖 Read `/home/fisch/projects/deck-forge/.session_logs/2026-01/20260131_0131_624ec29c.md`


## Claude

Yes, this project has session memory. I found your previous work on the **NMA Migration Toolkit** deck:

**Session: January 31, 2026**

You created a 31-slide deck from the source document at:
```
/home/fisch/projects/nma-toolkit-migrate/docs/TOOLKIT_ARCHITECTURE.md
```

The deck covers:
- 4-stage pipeline (Parsing → Extraction → Enrichment → Generation)
- Tree-sitter AST parsing
- Extractor patterns (NWP, Bridge, WebSocket)
- Knowledge base enrichment
- Migration workflow with GitHub Copilot
- Example prompts for Copilot-assisted migration

**Key details from that session:**
- Audience: Developers (async review format)
- Theme: `plato` (light mode)
- 8 Mermaid diagrams were added
- Several fixes for overflow issues and dark code blocks

The deck was moved to `~/presentations/nma-toolkit-architecture/` by the SessionEnd hook.

Would you like to continue working on that deck, or do something else with it?

## User

the input information we used for that deck has some changes we need to incorporate into the document, \\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu\home\fisch\projects\nma-toolkit-migrate\docs\TOOLKIT_ARCHITECTURE.md

## Claude

Let me read the updated source document and the current deck to identify what's changed.

### Actions

- 📖 Read `/home/fisch/projects/nma-toolkit-migrate/docs/TOOLKIT_ARCHITECTURE.md`
### Actions

- 📖 Read `/home/fisch/presentations/nma-toolkit-architecture/deck.md`



## Claude

I can see the key change: **Python support has been added to the toolkit**. The source document now includes:

1. Python as a supported language (line 12: "PHP/AngularJS/Python")
2. `PythonNwpExtractor` as a new extractor
3. Python patterns: `SJ.nwp()`, `ServiceJunction.nwp()`
4. Python parser in the data flow diagram
5. tree-sitter-python grammar

Let me create a plan for updating the deck to incorporate these changes.

### Actions

- ✏️ Wrote `/home/fisch/.claude/plans/structured-brewing-ladybug.md` (54 lines)


## Claude

I've identified 5 slides that need updates to incorporate Python support. The changes are straightforward:

**Slides to update:**
1. **Slide 1** (Title) - Add "Python" to subtitle
2. **Slide 5** (Pipeline diagram) - Add Python as input
3. **Slide 10** (Parsers table) - Add Python/tree-sitter-python row
4. **Slide 11** (Extractors diagram) - Add PythonNwpExtractor
5. **Slide 14** (Patterns table) - Add `SJ.nwp()` and `ServiceJunction.nwp()` patterns

The deck location is `/home/fisch/presentations/nma-toolkit-architecture/deck.md`.
