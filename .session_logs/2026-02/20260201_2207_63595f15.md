## User

can you preview the latest deck

### Actions

- 🔍 Glob `**/deck.md` in `.`


## Claude

No `deck.md` files found in the project. The git status shows the recent decks were deleted (moved to `~/presentations/` per the project workflow).

Let me check if there are any decks in the presentations folder.

### Actions

- 🔍 Glob `**/deck.md` in `/home/fisch/presentations`


## Claude

Found decks in `~/presentations/`. The most recent based on git history is `gigapower-metrics`. Let me preview it.

### Actions

## User

do you have a project memory feature? search for working on a deck that discussed "NMA migration"

## Claude

Yes, this project has session memory in `.session_logs/`. Let me search for NMA migration.

### Actions

- 🔍 Grep `NMA migration` in `.session_logs`


## Claude

Found it. There are two recent sessions about the NMA Migration Toolkit deck. Let me read the most recent one.

### Actions

- 📖 Read `/home/fisch/projects/deck-forge/.session_logs/2026-01/20260201_0034_ba0cd563.md`


## Claude

Found it. The last session worked on the **NMA Migration Toolkit** deck at `/home/fisch/presentations/nma-toolkit-architecture/`. You were:
- Adding density classes (`dense-1`, `dense-2`, `dense-3`) to fix overflow slides
- Fixing Mermaid diagrams (changing `\n` to `<br>` for line breaks)
- Iteratively reviewing slides for layout issues

The rendered version with Mermaid SVGs is `deck.rendered.md`. Want me to start the preview?

### Actions

- 💻 `./scripts/build.sh preview /home/fisch/presentations/nma-toolkit-architecture/deck.rendered.md` — Start Marp preview for NMA toolkit deck
### Actions

- 💻 `sleep 2 && cat /tmp/claude-1000/-home-fisch-projects-deck-forge/tasks/bed33a5.output` — Check preview server output


## Claude

Preview running. Browser should have opened with the NMA Migration Toolkit deck.

## User

do you have memory of the input file that was used as source info for that deck

## Claude

Let me check the earlier session log that has the deck creation details.

### Actions

- 📖 Read `/home/fisch/projects/deck-forge/.session_logs/2026-01/20260131_0131_624ec29c.md`


## Claude

Yes. According to the session log, the NMA Migration Toolkit deck was created from:

**Primary source:**
`/home/fisch/projects/nma-toolkit-migrate/docs/TOOLKIT_ARCHITECTURE.md`

**Additional source (for Copilot workflow section):**
`/home/fisch/projects/nma-toolkit-migrate/docs/INSTALLATION_AND_USAGE.md` — specifically Part 6: "Migration Workflow with GitHub Copilot" (lines 417-663)

The session memory captured the outline you approved and the iterative feedback about:
- Changing slide 3 from "firewall constraints" to "tailored for how developers work with Copilot"
- Expanding the Copilot workflow section (slides 23-27)
- Using `plato` theme (light) instead of `turing` (dark)

## User
