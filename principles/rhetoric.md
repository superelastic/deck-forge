# The Rhetoric of Decks

This document articulates the tacit knowledge beneath effective slide presentations — the unwritten rules that govern what makes a deck *work*. These patterns exist. People who've seen enough decks internalize them without being able to articulate them.

## The Fundamental Tension

A deck exists in the space between two failure modes:

**The document pretending to be slides**: Walls of text. Complete sentences. Everything you want to say, written out. The speaker becomes redundant — just reading what's already there. The audience reads ahead, stops listening.

**The mystery slides**: So sparse that without the speaker, they're meaningless. Three words and a stock photo. Looks slick, communicates nothing. Falls apart the moment someone tries to review it later.

**The goal**: A good deck is *incomplete on purpose* — it needs you to finish it — but *structured enough* that it scaffolds understanding even in your absence.

---

## Principle 1: The Unit of Thought Is the Slide

Each slide is one idea. Not one topic. Not one section. One *idea*.

If you find yourself saying "and also" or "another thing" while still on the same slide, you need another slide. Slides are cheap. Cognitive overload is expensive.

**The test**: Can you state the slide's idea in one sentence? If not, you have multiple slides masquerading as one.

---

## Principle 2: Titles Carry the Argument

Slide titles are not labels. They are assertions.

| Weak (Label) | Strong (Assertion) |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Results | Treatment increased distance by 61 miles on average |
| Literature Review | Prior work ignores the supply-side margin |
| Methods | We exploit county-level variation in clinic closures |
| Architecture | Three stateless services handle all routing decisions |
| Q3 Performance | Revenue exceeded forecast by 12% despite headcount freeze |

**The test**: If someone reads only your slide titles in sequence, they should understand your argument. The titles *are* the argument. Everything else is evidence and elaboration.

## Principle 3: The Pyramid Principle

Barbara Minto figured this out for consulting documents, but it applies to decks: **Lead with the conclusion. Then support it.**

Humans are not suspense novels. We don't want to follow your reasoning step by step and arrive at the punchline. We want the punchline, and then we want to understand why it's true.

**Correct structure**:
1. Here's what I'm going to tell you (the claim)
2. Here's the evidence for it
3. Here's why it matters

**Incorrect structure**:
1. Here's some background
2. Here's some more background
3. Here's a complication
4. Here's my analysis
5. Here's my finding (finally)

This is hard for technical people. We're trained to build arguments brick by brick. But audiences aren't reading — they're listening and watching. They need the scaffold first.

---

## Principle 4: Visual Hierarchy Is Meaning

What's big is important. What's first is important. What's isolated by white space is important.

If everything is the same size, nothing is important. If there are six bullet points of equal weight, you're asking the audience to do the work of figuring out which ones matter. They won't. They'll check their email.

**Use size, position, and space to do the cognitive work for them. Make the important thing obvious.**

---

## Principle 5: Bullets Are a Confession of Defeat

Bullet points are the default, and defaults are dangerous. A list of bullets says "I couldn't figure out the relationship between these ideas, so I'm just listing them."

Sometimes a list is right. When you have genuinely parallel items of equal weight, bullets work. But usually, there's a structure hiding in your bullets:

| Hidden Structure | Better Representation |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| A sequence | First → Then → Finally (numbered or visual flow) |
| A contrast | Two-column layout |
| A hierarchy | Heading + subpoints |
| A causal chain | Arrows, flowchart |

**Find the structure. Make it visible. Use layout, not bullets.**

---

## Principle 6: Tables and Figures Carry the Weight

In technical presentations, the table or figure is usually the point. The words around it are scaffolding.

**Common failure**: showing a dense regression table and saying "as you can see..." No. They cannot see. You have 45 seconds before they give up.

**What to do instead**:
- Highlight the one or two coefficients that matter
- Use color or boxes to draw the eye
- State the finding verbally while pointing
- Consider whether you need the full table, or just the key results visualized

**The figure should be readable from the back of the room. If it's not, it's not a slide — it's a handout.**

---

## Principle 7: Repetition Is Structure

Audiences forget. They zone out. They check their phones. They think about lunch.

Repetition is not redundancy — it's mercy. It's giving people multiple chances to catch the thread.

**Effective repetition**:
- Return to your main claim periodically
- Use consistent visual language (same colors mean same things)
- Echo key phrases
- Summarize before transitioning

**The mantra**: Tell them what you'll tell them. Tell them. Tell them what you told them.

---

## Principle 8: Transitions Are Invisible Architecture

The audience doesn't see the structure of your talk. They experience it as a sequence of moments. Transitions are where you make the structure visible.

**Transition language**:
- "So we've established X. Now the question is Y."
- "That's the theory. What about the evidence?"
- "So far I've shown A and B. The last piece is C."

Without transitions, a deck is just a pile of slides. With them, it's an argument.

---

## Principle 9: The Audience Is Not You

You've spent months on this. You know every detail. You find the complications fascinating.

They're seeing it for twenty minutes. They need:
- The main point, stated clearly
- Enough evidence to believe it
- A reason to care

Everything else is for the appendix, the paper, the follow-up conversation. **The deck is the trailer, not the movie.**

---

## Principle 10: Anxiety Makes Decks Worse

When you're nervous about presenting, you put more on the slides. More text, more backup, more "just in case." The slides become a security blanket.

But this backfires. Dense slides are harder to present. You lose your place. You read instead of talk. The audience senses your anxiety.

**Sparse slides force you to know your material. They make you the authority, not the slides.** This is terrifying and also correct.

---

## Special Case: The Deck as Documentation

When making a deck for asynchronous review — not for live presentation, but as documentation — the rules shift somewhat. You're not performing. You're preserving.

In this case:
- Be more explicit than you would for live presentation
- Include the "why" behind choices, not just the "what"
- Write in complete thoughts where necessary
- Date everything
- Assume the reader has forgotten the context

The deck becomes a letter to someone who shares your goals but not your current memory. Be kind to that person.

---

## Summary: The Defaults

1. One idea per slide
2. Titles are assertions, not labels
3. Lead with conclusions, support with evidence
4. Use visual hierarchy to signal importance
5. Find structure beyond bullet points
6. Make figures readable and highlighted
7. Repeat for retention
8. Transition explicitly
9. Respect the audience's limited attention
10. Resist the anxiety-driven urge to over-fill

These are the patterns. They're not rules to follow blindly — they're defaults to deviate from intentionally. But you have to know them before you can break them.
