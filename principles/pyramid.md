# The Pyramid Principle for Presentations

The Pyramid Principle, developed by Barbara Minto at McKinsey, is the foundation for executive communication. It inverts how most people naturally present information.

## The Core Insight

**You think from the bottom up, but you present from the top down.**

When analyzing a problem, you gather data, identify patterns, and build toward a conclusion. This is inductive reasoning — natural for research and analysis.

When presenting, you do the opposite. State the conclusion first, then support it. This is deductive presentation — essential for busy audiences.

## SCQA Framework

Use this to structure your opening (first 1-3 slides):

| Element | Purpose | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **S**ituation | Establish shared context | "We launched the new API six months ago" |
| **C**omplication | Introduce the problem/change | "Adoption is 40% below forecast" |
| **Q**uestion | The question your deck answers | "How do we accelerate adoption?" |
| **A**nswer | Your recommendation/finding | "Focus on three high-value integrations" |

The Answer becomes the top of your pyramid. Everything after supports it.

## Applying to Slide Structure

### Executive Summary Slide (Slide 1-2)

Contains:
- The situation (one sentence)
- The complication (one sentence)  
- Your recommendation/conclusion (one sentence)
- Preview of 3 supporting points

This slide should make sense even if the reader sees nothing else.

### Supporting Section (Slides 3-N)

Each key point gets:
- A section header slide (assertion title)
- 2-4 evidence slides
- A transition to the next section

### Wrap-up (Final 1-2 slides)

- Restate conclusion
- Specific next steps / call to action
- (Optional) Appendix reference

---

## The Rule of Three

Limit yourself to three supporting points. Human working memory handles 3-4 items comfortably.

If you have more than three points:
- You haven't synthesized enough — group related points
- You're trying to cover too much — narrow scope
- Some points are actually sub-points — nest them

---

## Common Mistakes

**Building to the conclusion**: Starting with background, methodology, analysis, then finally revealing findings. Audiences lose interest waiting for the point.

**Burying the lead**: Putting the recommendation on slide 15. If someone has to sit through 14 slides before understanding what you think they should do, you've lost them.

**Equal-weight points**: Presenting five bullet points of equal importance. Prioritize. Lead with the most important.

**Missing the "so what"**: Presenting data without interpretation. "Revenue increased 12%" is data. "Revenue exceeded forecast by 12%, validating our pricing strategy" is insight.

## Deck Structure Template

```
Slide 1:  Title + one-sentence summary
Slide 2:  Executive Summary (SCQA + 3 key points)
Slide 3:  Key Point 1 (assertion title)
Slide 4:  Evidence for Point 1
Slide 5:  Evidence for Point 1 (continued if needed)
Slide 6:  Transition → "Now let's examine..."
Slide 7:  Key Point 2 (assertion title)
Slide 8:  Evidence for Point 2
...
Slide N-1: Conclusion restated + implications
Slide N:   Next steps / call to action
```

## Quick Reference

| Don't | Do |
|-------|-----|
| "Let me walk you through our analysis..." | "We should do X. Here's why." |
| "First, some background..." | "The situation is [brief context]" |
| "In conclusion..." (on slide 20) | "My recommendation is..." (on slide 2) |
| Five equal bullet points | Three prioritized assertions |
| "As you can see from the data..." | "The data shows [specific insight]" |
