# Template: Proposal / Recommendation

Use this template when presenting a recommendation that requires a decision. The audience needs to understand what you're proposing, why, and what happens next.

---

## Audience Profile

- Decision-makers with limited time
- Need confidence that recommendation is sound
- Will ask "why this?" and "why not alternatives?"
- Need clear next steps

---

## Structure (Pyramid Principle)

### Section 1: The Recommendation (Slides 1-3)

**Slide 1 — Title**
- Clear statement of the recommendation
- Not "Project Proposal" but "We should [do X]"

**Slide 2 — Executive Summary**
- Situation (one sentence): Current state
- Complication (one sentence): The problem/opportunity
- Recommendation (one sentence): What you propose
- Impact (one sentence): Expected outcome

**Slide 3 — Three Reasons Why**
- Preview of your three supporting arguments
- Each is an assertion, not a topic

### Section 2: Supporting Arguments (Slides 4-9)

**Slides 4-5 — Argument 1**
- Slide 4: Assertion (title) + key evidence
- Slide 5: Supporting data/analysis (if needed)

**Slides 6-7 — Argument 2**
- Same structure

**Slides 8-9 — Argument 3**
- Same structure

### Section 3: Addressing Concerns (Slides 10-11)

**Slide 10 — Why Not Alternatives?**
- Brief comparison to other options considered
- Why this recommendation wins

**Slide 11 — Risks and Mitigations**
- Acknowledge main risks
- Show you've thought about how to handle them

### Section 4: The Ask (Slides 12-13)

**Slide 12 — What We Need**
- Specific resources/approvals required
- Investment and timeline

**Slide 13 — Next Steps**
- Immediate actions if approved
- Who does what by when
- Decision needed by [date]

## Key Principles for Proposals

**Lead with the ask.** Don't make people wait until slide 15 to find out what you want.

**Quantify impact.** "Increase efficiency" is weak. "Reduce processing time by 40%" is strong.

**Acknowledge trade-offs.** Showing you've considered risks and alternatives builds credibility.

**Be specific about the ask.** "We need your support" is vague. "We need $50K budget approval by March 1" is actionable.

**End with next steps.** Make it easy to say yes by showing exactly what happens after approval.

## Customization Notes

- For smaller asks, compress to 6-8 slides total
- For large investments, expand supporting evidence
- Add detailed appendix for technical audiences who want to dig deeper
- Adjust formality of language based on audience
