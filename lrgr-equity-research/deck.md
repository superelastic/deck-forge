# Luminar Media Group (LRGR)

## Initiation of Coverage: BUY

**OTC: LRGR | Reserved NASDAQ: FRTU**
January 18, 2026

---

# BUY with $1.75 target implies 157% upside

<div class="columns">
<div>

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Current Price | $0.68 |
| Target Price | **$1.75** |
| Market Cap | ~$61M |
| Risk Profile | Venture / High Volatility |

</div>
<div>

| 9M 2025 Performance | |
|---------------------|-------|
| Revenue | $5.73M (+61% YoY) |
| Pre-tax Net Income | $2.82M |
| Net Margin | **~49%** |
| EPS Growth | +102% |

</div>
</div>

<!--
The disconnect: OTC valuation vs. NASDAQ-quality fundamentals.
49% net margin is structurally anomalous in early-stage fintech.

# The thesis rests on three pillars

<div class="columns">
<div>

**1. Structural Arbitrage**
The "Uplist Trade" — NASDAQ listing unlocks 2-4x multiple expansion

**2. Demographic Alpha**
The "Latino GDP" — $3T+ underbanked market with high loyalty

</div>
<div>

**3. Operational Leverage**
Profitable hyper-growth — 61% revenue growth with 49% margins

</div>
</div>

> Current valuation prices in failure, not the growth reality

<!--
Each pillar is independently compelling. Together they create asymmetric upside.
-->

---

<!-- _class: transition -->

# Pillar 1: Structural Arbitrage

The NASDAQ uplist is a procedural inevitability, not a theoretical ambition

---

# Institutional capital cannot access LRGR at current prices

**The Liquidity Discount Problem:**

- OTC listings are *prohibited* by most institutional mandates
- Price thresholds, exchange governance, and liquidity requirements exclude LRGR
- Result: Company trades at venture multiples despite institutional-grade metrics

**Historical Precedent:**
Micro-cap companies migrating OTC → NASDAQ see **2x to 4x multiple expansion** as they become eligible for Russell indices and small-cap ETFs

<!--
This is pure arbitrage — same company, different venue, different valuation.
-->

---

# Management has systematically cleared every uplist hurdle

| Milestone | Status | Date |
|-----------|--------|------|
| PCAOB audit (2023 & 2024) | **Complete** | Dec 2025 |
| Legacy debt settlement ($391K) | **Complete** | Dec 2025 |
| Dilution reduced | **~80% reduction** | Dec 2025 |
| Form S-1 submitted (confidential) | **Complete** | Dec 2025 |
| Ticker "FRTU" reserved with NASDAQ | **Complete** | Dec 2025 |
| R.F. Lafferty engaged as underwriter | **Complete** | Dec 2025 |

> The uplist is now a matter of *when*, not *if*

# Pillar 2: Demographic Alpha

Banking the unbanked: the Latino SMB opportunity

---

# U.S. Latino GDP would rank 5th globally — yet remains underbanked

<div class="columns">
<div>

**The Market Gap:**
- Fastest-growing SMB segment in the U.S.
- High entrepreneurial rates
- Low banking penetration
- FICO models penalize "thin file" businesses

</div>
<div>

**Why Banks Fail Here:**
- Underwriting relies on FICO + credit history
- Immigrant entrepreneurs often have insufficient (not bad) credit
- Cash-heavy businesses appear "risky" to algorithms
- Result: creditworthy businesses locked out

</div>
</div>

<!--
This isn't subprime lending — it's lending to businesses banks misprice.
-->

---

# Fortun's "Cash Flow First" model bypasses the FICO bottleneck

**Traditional Bank Underwriting:**
FICO Score → Credit History → Collateral → *Decision*

**Fortun's Approach:**
Real-time Bank Data → Cash Flow Analysis → Repayment Ability → *Decision*

<div class="columns">
<div>

**Key Metrics Analyzed:**
- Average Daily Balance
- Deposit Frequency
- NSF (bounced check) Days
- Existing funder payments

</div>
<div>

**The Moat:**
- Bilingual relationship managers
- Cultural competence builds trust
- Higher conversion & retention
- Lower long-term CAC

</div>
</div>

# Pillar 3: Operational Leverage

Profitable hyper-growth in a market that demands both

---

# 61% revenue growth with ~49% net margins is an industry outlier

<div class="columns">
<div>

**2020-2021 Fintech Playbook:**
"Growth at all costs" → Negative margins

**2024-2026 Market Demands:**
Profitability *and* growth

**LRGR Has Delivered Both:**
- Low-cost digital origination
- High organic referral rates
- Lean corporate structure
- Capital recycling (1.3-1.5x/year)

</div>
<div>

| Metric | 9M 2025 | YoY |
|--------|---------|-----|
| Revenue | $5.73M | +61.2% |
| Operating Income | $2.94M | +66.8% |
| Pre-tax Net Income | $2.82M | +65.9% |
| Basic EPS | $0.0336 | +102.4% |

</div>
</div>

<!--
Q3 2025 alone was ~$2.18M revenue — accelerating run rate.
Management projects ~$12M annualized heading into 2026.

# Revenue-Based Financing aligns lender and borrower incentives

**How RBF Works:**

```
Merchant receives:     $50,000 advance
Merchant repays:       $65,000 (Factor Rate: 1.30x)
Repayment method:      10-20% of daily revenue
Term:                  ~6-9 months
```

**Key Distinction from Traditional Loans:**
- No fixed monthly payment — repayment scales with merchant's sales
- If sales drop, payments drop proportionally
- Fortun only gets paid when the merchant generates revenue

**Speed is the value prop:** Application to funding in <24 hours vs. 60-90 days for banks

# The renewal flywheel doubles profitability per customer

| Metric | Initial Deal | Renewal Deal |
|--------|--------------|--------------|
| Funded Amount | $10,000 | $10,000 |
| Factor Rate | 1.35x | 1.35x |
| Gross Revenue | $3,800 | $3,800 |
| ISO Commission | ($1,000) | **$0** |
| Loss Provision | ($800) | ($400) |
| Cost of Funds | ($400) | ($400) |
| **Net Contribution** | **$1,600** | **$3,000+** |

> Renewals require zero marketing spend and near-zero broker commission

<!--
First deal covers CAC. Renewals drive profitability.
61% revenue growth + stable CAC = high renewal rate.
-->

---

# Balance sheet has been systematically de-risked

<div class="columns">
<div>

**Legacy Debt Settlement:**
- $391,590 in toxic convertible notes settled
- Original terms: $0.01/share conversion
- Would have created ~39M new shares
- Settlement issued 7.9M shares instead
- **~80% dilution reduction**
- Lock-up agreements in place

</div>
<div>

**Capital Position:**
- $3M+ raised in Oct 2025 private placement
- Oversubscribed 6x
- Funds loan book expansion
- PCAOB audit provides institutional verification

</div>
</div>

> Legacy liabilities eliminated. Growth capital secured.

# LRGR trades at a discount despite superior growth metrics

| Company | Ticker | Market Cap | P/E (FWD) | Focus |
|---------|--------|------------|-----------|-------|
| Enova International | ENVA | ~$2.4B | 7.0x | Subprime Consumer & SMB |
| OppFi | OPFI | ~$600M | 6.5x | Near-prime Consumer |
| **Luminar Media** | **LRGR** | **~$61M** | **~10x implied** | **Minority SMB RBF** |

**Why the discount?**
- OTC listing excludes institutional buyers
- Micro-cap liquidity constraints
- Legacy shell company perception

**Why it's mispriced:**
- Growing 61% vs. peers at 15-20%
- Higher margins than peers
- Imminent catalyst (uplist)

---

# Three reinforcing moats protect the business

<div class="columns">
<div>

**1. Data Asset Moat**
Every loan generates proprietary data on Latino SMB behavior — payment hierarchies, seasonality, default triggers. Algorithm improves with scale.

**2. Cultural Affinity Moat**
Trust is tangible in minority finance. Bilingual service + transparency builds loyalty that rate-shopping can't break.

</div>
<div>

**3. Regulatory Compliance Moat**
NY, CA, UT disclosure laws require sophisticated infrastructure. As a public, PCAOB-audited company, LRGR is positioned to survive regulatory shakeout.

> Compliance kills smaller competitors

</div>
</div>

---

# Management has executed the turnaround with precision

**Pivot Execution:**
- Transformed dormant media shell → operating fintech via FortunCo acquisition
- Immediately scaled revenue post-integration
- Maintained profitability throughout transition

**Leadership:**
- **Yoel Damas (CEO)**: Attorney background — critical for navigating state-by-state lending regulations
- **Juan Sese (VP Finance)**: Banking background — coordinated complex audit process

**Track Record:**
Every stated milestone (audit, debt settlement, S-1, underwriter) delivered on schedule

---

# Key risks: regulatory, credit cycle, and liquidity

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| **Regulatory reclassification** | Critical | MCA structure legally distinct from loans; compliance investment ongoing |
| **Credit cycle downturn** | High | Unsecured lending; recession could spike defaults from ~8% to 20%+ |
| **OTC liquidity** | Medium | Uplist process underway; thin trading volume until then |
| **Capital concentration** | Medium | Loan book growth depends on continued capital access |

**Bear Case Scenario (<$0.10):**
Regulatory shock caps factor rates *or* recession spikes defaults *or* NASDAQ application denied

---

# Valuation: Base case $1.00, Bull case $1.75

<div class="columns">
<div>

**Base Case (P/E Method):**
- 2026E Net Income: $6.0M
- Multiple: 15x (growth premium)
- Implied Market Cap: $90M
- **Price Target: $1.00**

</div>
<div>

**Bull Case (Post-Uplist):**
- 2026E Revenue: $15-20M
- Multiple: 20x P/E or 4x Revenue
- Implied Market Cap: $160M
- **Price Target: $1.75**

</div>
</div>

**Multiple Justification:**
- LRGR growing >60% vs. peers at 15-20%
- Pure-play Latino fintech scarcity value
- Uplist unlocks institutional demand

---

# Three scenarios bound the outcome

| Scenario | Price | Probability | Key Assumptions |
|----------|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Bull** | $1.75+ | 30% | Uplist in 1H 2026; institutional buying; direct channel scales; M&A optionality |
| **Base** | $1.00-1.25 | 50% | Uplist delayed to late 2026; 30-40% growth; remains profitable |
| **Bear** | <$0.10 | 20% | Regulatory shock; recession; NASDAQ denial |

**Expected Value Calculation:**
(0.30 × $1.75) + (0.50 × $1.12) + (0.20 × $0.05) = **$1.09**

> Current price of $0.68 implies 60% expected return

---

# Summary: Three things to remember

1. **The Uplist Trade is real** — Every milestone cleared, NASDAQ application imminent. Institutional access = multiple expansion.

2. **The Latino GDP is a durable tailwind** — $3T+ underbanked market with high loyalty. Cultural competence is a moat.

3. **Profitability validates the model** — 49% net margins at 61% growth is not accidental. Unit economics work.

> The market prices LRGR as a failing OTC shell. The reality is a profitable, growing fintech executing a clear roadmap.
